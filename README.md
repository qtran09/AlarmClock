# AlarmClock
Simple program that plays a sound after a set interval. Made to make me more wary of the time while using my computer. It's a very basic design right now. I was able to learn more about JavaFX and how animation work using this library and how to update values in real time, specifically using the Timeline API. 

Hopefully this will help fix my sleep schedule.
